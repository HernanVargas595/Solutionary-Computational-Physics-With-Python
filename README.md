This project is about the elaboration of a solutionary of the book "Computational Physics
With Python" by Dr. Eric Ayars.

I elaborate a previous summarize about this topics in each capitule, using the most useful tools in my consideration and the we elaborate the solution of the examples. The goal is upload data files with the solutions separated for chapters, and I add the updates when I finish the work with the respective chapter. 

The chapters so far are:

Chapter 0-Useful Introductory Python
Chapter 1-Python Basics
Chapter 2-Basic Numerical Tools
Chapter 3-Numpy, Scipy, and MatPlotLib
Chapter 4-Ordinary Differential Equations
Chapter 5-Chaos
Chapter 6-Monte Carlo Techniques
Chapter 7-Stochastic Methods
Chapter 8-Partial Differential Equations
Appendix A-Linux
Appendix B-Visual Python
Appendix C-Least-Squares Fitting
